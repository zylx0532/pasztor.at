In our [previous episode](/blog/api-first-1) we have discussed a broad overview of an API-driven software how I do it.
In this installment I would like to run you through setting up the backend.

# Pre-requisites

If you are not well versed in Java or OOP, you may want to do some additional reading. More specifically, I would
recommend the following posts on this blog:

- [Getting started in Object-Oriented Programming](/blog/oop-basics)
- [What people misunderstand about OOP](/blog/oop-misunderstandings)
- [A few words on null](/blog/nullable)
- [Clean Code: Dependencies](/blog/clean-code-dependencies)
- [Clean Code: Responsibilities](/blog/clean-code-responsibilities)
- [Make all classes final!](/blog/make-everything-final)
- [Why immutability matters](/blog/why-immutability-matters)

These posts will help you understand OOP better, and that, in turn, will help you with Java. And don't worry too much,
I will explain each step in detail.

## Grab the source code

If you want to grab the source code of this article
[head on over to GitHub](https://github.com/janoszen/api-first/tree/0.0.2).

## Installing a development environment

For a development environment I strongly recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). If you are
unfamiliar with heavy IDEs and only used lightweight editors, trust me on this. IntelliJ helps you with autocompleting
your code and letting you know if you mistype something.

Once you have installed IntelliJ, go to File &rarr; New &rarr; Project and start a new **Maven** project. Maven here
is the dependency manager of choice for our project. Alternative package managers like Gradle also exist, but for now
let's stick with Maven.

In the next step you will be asked for the *group ID* and *artifact ID* for the project. In Java these are similar
to package names in other languages. It is customary to use your domain name as a group ID, such as `at.pasztor`. The
artifact ID would be the project name, for example in my case it would be `backend`. So full package
&ldquo;coordinates&rdquo; with the version would look like this: `at.pasztor:backend:1.0-SNAPSHOT`

Once you go through the process you will be greeted with a project that contains a few files. Most importantly, you
will see a file called `pom.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>at.pasztor</groupId>
    <artifactId>backend</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>


</project>
```

This is your project file that contains all your build configuration, such as dependencies, build plugins, etc. For now 
it's pretty empty, but we will change that soon. For now, you may receive a popup that prompts you to Auto-Import
changes to your `pom.xml`, which I would strongly recommend to enable:

![](/img/intellij-auto-import-maven.png)

## Writing a test application

For now, let's create a simple demo to check if everything is working. Let's create a file called
`src/main/java/TestApplication.java` by right clicking on the `src/main/java` folder and selecting
`New &rarr; Java Class`. 

![](/img/intellij-new-java-file.png)

The contents of the files should be the following:

```java
public class TestApplication {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

Pretty simple, but let's break it down nonetheless. This is a class in Java, just like the OOP articles I recommended
above. This class contains a single method which is declared `static`. Static is a special case because they are 
functions that can be called without creating an instance of the class. In other languages you might implement this as
a simple function, but in Java everything needs to be in classes.

Now, the `public static void main(String[] argv)` method in Java is even more special, as it is a starting point for 
your application. The `argv` parameter itself contains the command line parameters, if any.

IntelliJ is very helpful, by clicking the play button next to the method you can simply run the application:

![](/img/intellij-run.png)

This will pop up a little terminal window with the program running in it.

## Setting up compiler basics

If the application compiles successfully we can now proceed to do some changes to `pom.xml` to make it behave the way 
we want it. First of all, we need to tell the Java compiler what language level we want it to use. In our case, we
should at the very least set Java version 8:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>at.pasztor</groupId>
    <artifactId>backend</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <java.version>1.8</java.version>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    </properties>
</project>
```

## Setting up Spring Boot

Now comes the moment where we actually start setting up our web application. First of all let's pull in the Spring Boot
web starter by adding the following section:

```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.6.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

This pulls in all the packages that are needed to create a web application with Spring Boot. In addition we will need to
pull in the Spring Boot starter parent as a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; package so our package inherits the default settings
that are required to compile Spring Boot applications properly.

```xml
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.6.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>
```

> **Note:** Packages in Maven can be hierarchical. The child packages inherit all the properties of parent packages.
> This is being used here so you don't have to do a lot of configuration in Maven yourself.

As a final step to see it in action let's *delete* the `TestApplication` and instead create a class called
`at.pasztor.backend.BlogApplication`. This will create the appropriate folders for this package and place the
`BlogApplication` class inside. (You can of course opt to use your own package name.)

> *Warning!* Never place the application in the default namespace as that will cause all sorts of problems!

> *Note:* The package name `at.pasztor.backend` corresponds to the group ID and artifact ID in pom.xml. This is purely
> for convenience, but there is no rule enforcing this.

The `BlogApplication` class should look as follows:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class BlogApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BlogApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

If you now start this application and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) you will see a less than
glorious error page, but nevertheless, this is already our backend application working.

## Writing our first controller

Now comes the fun part: let's actually do something useful. Let's create a class named `IndexController` next to
the `BlogApplication` with the following content:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {
    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String index() {
        return "Hello world!";
    }
}
```

Now, in order to apply the changes we will need to restart the application. This can be done by hitting the restart
button next to the little terminal window the application is running in:

![](/img/intellij-restart.png)

Once the server is restarted you should see the results on the screen. Now, what exactly did we do?

The `@Controller` or `@RestController` annotations tell Spring Boot to consider this class as a recipient of requests
from users. The `@RequestMapping` annotation on the other hand contains the actual routing information on requests that
should be routed to the method.

## JSON responses

So what if we want to send back a JSON response instead of a text document? Let's create a test response object as 
follows:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

public class TestResponse {
    public final String message;

    public TestResponse(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
}
```

This will be our message container. The constructor will accept our parameter and store it in the `message` variable.
This variable is declared `final` for [immutability](/blog/why-immutability-matters). Our controller will be changed as
follows:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {
    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/",
            produces = "application/json"
    )
    public TestResponse index() {
        return new TestResponse("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

And just like that you will receive a JSON response after reloading the application. Spring Boot uses a library called
[jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) to automatically convert objects into JSON
representations and back. It also provides helpful annotations such as `@JsonIgnore` to influence how the JSON is
generated.

## Consuming input parameters

An API isn't the most useful without the user being able to send us some data back, so let's take a look how to
consume input parameters.

### Path variables

Remember our example from the [first episode](/blog/api-first-1)? We said we wanted to have something like
`/books/1234`. Here it may be useful to extract 1234 as a variable. In Spring Boot terms this is called path variable.
Consider the following controller:


```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class BookController {
    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/books/{id}"
    )
    public String book(
            @PathVariable
            String id
    ) {
        return "This is book " + id;
    }
}
```

Here the `@RequestMapping` contains a variable in the form of `{id}`, and a parameter in the method contains the 
`@PathVariable` annotation. These two are matched up and the data type is converted automatically as needed.

### Query parameters

The next option to consume input parameters are query strings. For example, you may want to provide a search option
in the book listing like this: `/books?search=Andersen`

In this case our controller could look as follows:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class BookController {
    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/books"
    )
    public String search(
            @RequestParam
            String search
    ) {
        return "Searching for " + search;
    }
}
```

Now, this makes `search` a required parameter and if it is not passed, an error will be thrown. Alternatively you could
also write the `@RequestParam` annotation like this: `@RequestParam(required = false)`. This will make the parameter
optional. Be careful though, if it is not passed, the variable will not be an empty string but a `null` and you may need
to do a null-check. Therefore it is best to annotate optional parameters with `@Nullable` so that IntelliJ can warn you
about missing null-checks:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class BookController {
    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/books"
    )
    public String search(
            @Nullable
            @RequestParam(required = false)
            String search
    ) {
        if (search == null) {
            return "Not searching for anything";
        } else {
            return "Searching for " + search;
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note on `@Nullable`:** unfortunately there is no single standard on marking nullable variables in Java. There was
> a proposal called JSR-305, but it went nowhere and now each software vendor has their own `@Nullable` implementation.
> In our case we are using Spring Frameworks version, which IntelliJ can use to determine if a variable is nullable.
> For more information on nullability read my post called [&ldquo;A few words on null&rdquo;](/blog/nullable).

### Request body

The next option, for post requests for example, is to consume the request body with a data structure. So far we have
only been using `GET` requests from HTTP, but now it is time to introduce others, like `POST`, which are used for,
for example, form submissions.

In HTTP each request and response with a body should have a `Content-Type` associated with it. For classic web forms
this content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the request has the following format:

```
author=Hans+Christian+Andersen&title=The+Emperor's+New+Clothes
```

It is a bit hard to make out the parts of it, but basically it has the following format:

```
variable=[value, urlencoded]&nextvariable=[]&...
```

To consume these type or requests we can use the previously already introduced `@RequestParam` annotation:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class BookController {

    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/books",
            consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE
    )
    public String create(
            @RequestParam
            String title,
            @RequestParam
            String author
    ) {
        return "Created a book called " + title + " by " + author;
    }
}
```

However, if you now want to test this you will need something like the
[Advanced Rest Client](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install) as `POST` requests can't be submitted without
a form.

![](/img/arc-post-request.png)

Alternatively, if you are well versed in the console, you can use Telnet:

```
$ telnet localhost 8080
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 62
Connection: close

author=Hans+Christian+Andersen&title=The+Emperor's+New+Clothes
```

Now, the situation becomes slightly more tricky when it comes to submitting `JSON` requests as is customary
with APIs in general. In this case we have to create a request object:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

public class CreateBookRequest {
    public final String title;
    public final String author;

    public CreateBookRequest(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
}
```

Then the controller can look as follows:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
public class BookController {
    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/books",
            consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE
    )
    public String create(
            @RequestBody
            CreateBookRequest request
    ) {
        return "Created a book called " + request.title + " by " + request.author;
    }
}
```

The `@RequestBody` annotation tells Spring Boot to decode the request body to an object, whereas the `consumes`
parameter tells Spring Boot to route requests with the JSON type to this method.

> **Tip:** you can have multiple methods with different `consumes` values to hande different data types. Spring Boot
> will route the requests accordingly. Similarly, the `produces` stanza can be used to indicate the produced response
> type and the client can decide using the `Accept` header which response type it wants.

### Headers

Finally, let's talk about consuming headers. These are very simple, the `@RequestHeader` annotation does the trick here.

## Handling errors

If during your experiments you have tried to send a request that is incomplete, or you tried to access an URL that is
not mapped, you may have received an error like this:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-10-13T18:21:01.690+0000",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Required String parameter 'title' is not present",
  "path": "/books"
}
```

While this is useful, you may prefer to have your own error handling, or ideally convert exceptions into output
directly. Generally there are two cases we want to handle:

1. Our application threw an exception, which should be output to the user in a reasonable fashion.
2. Spring Boot threw an exception, e.g. the above Bad Request exception.

For both cases we will need a bit of preparation work. First of all, let's create a class called ApiException like
this:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

public class ApiException extends Exception {
    //Don't output this to the JSON, this will be used only as a HTTP status.
    @JsonIgnore
    public final HttpStatus status;
    public final ErrorCode error;
    public final String errorMessage;

    public ApiException(HttpStatus status, ErrorCode error, String errorMessage) {
        this.status = status;
        this.error = error;
        this.errorMessage = errorMessage;
    }

    public enum ErrorCode {
        TEST,
        NOT_FOUND
    }
}
```

This will allow us to throw exceptions that are then properly converted to JSON in a manner that we control, with the 
`error` field containing the error code and the `errorMessage` field containing the actual error message. Having
errors like this is extremely useful to anyone consuming our API, including our own frontend. The enum will list
all possible values for the error code, which makes it less of a guesswork to use the API.

Now we need to build an error handler. First of all, let's handle exceptions from our own application:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;

@Controller
@ControllerAdvice
public class ErrorController {
    @ExceptionHandler(value = { ApiException.class })
    public ResponseEntity<ApiException> onException(ApiException apiException) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(
            apiException,
            apiException.status
        );
    }
}
```

The `@ControllerAdvice` annotation will make this class a handler for all exceptions, while the `@ExceptionHandler` will
declare the method that handles exceptions of the type `ApiException`. Other exceptions will be handled by the built-in
exception handler.

The `ResponseEntity` we return will invoke Spring Boots automatic object conversion. In other words, any `ApiException`
will be run through Jackson to be converted to JSON.

Now, let's create a test controller to throw an exception:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class ExceptionTestController {
    @RequestMapping("/exception")
    public void test() throws ApiException {
        throw new ApiException(
                HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
                ApiException.ErrorCode.TEST,
                "This is a test."
        );
    }
}
```

If you call the URL [http://localhost:8080/exception](http://localhost:8080/exception) you will, quite surprisingly,
see the following:

```json
{
cause: null,
stackTrace: [
  //...
],
error: "TEST",
errorMessage: "This is a test.",
message: null,
localizedMessage: null,
suppressed: [ ]
}
```

These extra fields are in the response because they are properties of exceptions in Java. These are not useful to us,
and indeed the stack trace could leak information about our application to the user. To hide the extra parameters we can
change the `ApiException` class to have Jackson ignore those parameters:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = {
        "detailMessage",
        "cause",
        "stackTrace",
        "suppressedExceptions",
        "backtrace",
        "message",
        "localizedMessage",
        "suppressed"
})
public class ApiException extends Exception {
    @JsonIgnore
    public final HttpStatus status;
    public final ErrorCode error;
    public final String errorMessage;

    public ApiException(HttpStatus status, ErrorCode error, String errorMessage) {
        this.status = status;
        this.error = error;
        this.errorMessage = errorMessage;
    }

    public enum ErrorCode {
        TEST,
        NOT_FOUND
    }
}
```

The `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation will cause Jackson to ignore the specified fields and let us produce a clean
output.

Now that we have our exception handler in place, we can change the `ErrorController` to include handling of Spring Boot
internal errors, such as when a route was not found:

```java
package at.pasztor.backend;


import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

@Controller
@ControllerAdvice
public class ErrorController implements org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.error.ErrorController {
    @Override
    public String getErrorPath() {
        return "/error";
    }

    @RequestMapping(
            value = "/error",
            produces = "application/json"
    )
    public ResponseEntity<Void> errorJson(HttpServletRequest request) throws ApiException {
        Object status = request.getAttribute(RequestDispatcher.ERROR_STATUS_CODE);

        if (status != null) {
            int statusCode = Integer.parseInt(status.toString());
            switch (statusCode) {
                case 404:
                    throw new ApiException(
                            HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND,
                            ApiException.ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND,
                            "The requested API endpoint was not found."
                    );
            }
            return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.valueOf(statusCode));
        }
        return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(value = { ApiException.class })
    public ResponseEntity<ApiException> onException(ApiException apiException) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(
            apiException,
            apiException.status
        );
    }
}
```

As you can see in the code, we specify that `/error` is the alias for the error page, and below that we specify a 
regular `@RequestMapping` for said URL. In this variant we are producing a JSON output, but as before, you could
create a second method for producing HTML output.

In the error page method we try to find out what the cause of the error is. If it is a 404 (not found) we simply
throw an `ApiException` to that effect, which will be caught and processed by our exception handler.

## Next up

In the next installment of this series we will take a look at connecting a database. We will start writing a blog
application, store and retrieve blog posts. Stay tuned.
