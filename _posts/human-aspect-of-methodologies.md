BDD, TDD, Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, Extreme Programming? There are dozens if not hundreds of methodologies that aim to make
your software development and teamwork more efficient, less error-prone and in better in every aspect. Yet, we hear
so many horror stories about how these things went wrong to one degree or another.

The blame, quite often, falls on the methodology. TDD is too hard or inefficient. Scrum is bulldung. You must have heard
such strong opinions before if you work in the industry. But how can so many methodologies, thought up by smart people,
be wrong that badly?

In my experience these methodologies are at not at fault here. Each of them can be used to great effect, or can
absolutely ruin your experience and send you running back to your old methods to get anything done.

When saying this I can already hear the agile coach saying: *&ldquo;You are doing it wrong. You haven't implemented
it correctly. You need to adapt agile to your organization.&rdquo;*

Yes, they are right, you did not implement it correctly and you haven't adapted it. But what is not answered is *how*.
To me these issues are not a problem of *process*. Thinking back at my professional past, this is exclusively a problem
with *humans*. Or more specifically, the way *humans* have been treated.

Humans have emotions, not just in their private life, but also at work. Emotions such as *pride*. Or *stress*. *Fear*.
*Jealousy*. What I have seen countless times is that a team member or even worse, an external coach or scrum master,
gets put into position and starts telling everyone how this new methodology works and what process people are supposed
to follow.

*Process*. Implicitly, the process implies that people don't know how to do their work, that's why we need to enforce
rules on them. And, don't get me wrong, that may be absolutely true. Heck, if I don't force myself to write tests, for
example, I make painfully obvious and stupid mistakes. This was always true, but what wasn't is the fact that over the
years I learned to accept this as a fact and write tests for my code. The same is also true about my time management
skills, which the whole *agile* thing helps with.

So how do you get people to accept that they are humans and maybe just a little process is not such a bad idea? What 
are the factors the factors that make or break such a project? 

## Personal Pride and Introversion

Engineers are *proud* people. Many of us got into the profession because we wanted to *create* something. Our projects
are our babies, we are emotionally invested in them. If someone compromises our vision of the project, or we feel that
our opinions are being disregarded by some new manager, scrum master, or our boss, our motivation drops and our 
productivity grinds to a halt. If given the choice in such a situation we will happily vote to kill off the whole
new methodology project.

What also doesn't help in this process is that there are a lot of discussions to be had about how things should be done.
A lot of us being *introverts* to some degree or another, having large discussions in meeting rooms with a lot of people
intimidates us. Of course, I would have never admitted to this even a year ago, but it's true. These discussions on
how we should do things in the future are exhausting and are usually won by the person with the strongest opinion.

A good boss, scrum master or agile coach can do a lot to help the individual team members in this situations, making 
their voice heard. However, not like you might think. Imposing some rules on the discussions, such as everyone gets to
talk for five minutes (yet more process) will not alleviate our fears. As much as my colleagues wouldn't think so, I
*hate* speaking in a group if I'm not a 100% sure about what I'm saying.

I'm much more comfortable discussing my opinions in private over a coffee. Yes, the coffee machine in the office can be
a great project management tool. It is much easier to open up in a one on one conversation, trying to flesh out a 
half-baked idea, find the right words to explain what exactly one means. It will also be easier if the boss/coach/scrum
master brings up the topic in the conversation and the team member in with the idea knows that they don't have to stand
up for themselves and risk being alone in the room. After all, they have the at least one other voice in the room
thinking that their idea is worth listening to.

> **Note:** Coffee is not a thing for everyone. Make sure you know what the person you are talking to considers a
> comfortable and safe environment.

## The New Boss and Restructuring

One unfortunate situation a team and their leader, scrum master, or other person of influence can get into is when
someone who does not enjoy the trust of the team gets put into a position of power. This may be an external scrum master
or agile coach who is now supposed to tell a team how to structure their work, or a hired team lead. Anyhow, when
a new team member is hired, especially into a leadership position, it takes a while until this new team member gets
their bearings and knows how the team &ldquo;ticks&rdquo;. The team also needs to bond and learn to trust the new
member or leader.

This inevitably causes friction in the team, especially if the new leader starts changing things immediately, which
leads to a loss of efficiency. It can also lead to a feeling of frustration if the team members feel steamrolled by
the new direction. A good leader can somewhat soften the blow by listening to the team a lot in the initial few months.
The listening process will speed up the assimilation into the team, and being accepted as a cooperative team member.
This, of course, is not an option for an agile coach as they are usually hired for a limited amount of time.

An even larger disruption can be caused if not only a single person is changed, but a larger chunk of the company is
reorganized. Such a reorganization, even if the roles are defined in a crystal clear fashion, still cause a disruption
of work, since the people involved need to get their bearings.

Often times a small-scale trial of the new system can provide a positive input for the time when the larger roll-out is
happening later on. For example, say, you roll out TDD (Test Driven Development) across your development teams. If this
is done in such a way that only a single team starts testing in this fashion, inevitably, this team will have a learning
curve and will need to figure out how to do things under the new rule. However, this team, by going through this
learning curve will have the experience to help the other teams later on. They will, hopefully, be the torchbearers that
the new method really works and really increases productivity and quality over time. Or, in contrast, you might discover
issues with the new methodology and this way, the negative impact will be limited to one team instead of tanking the
whole company for a few weeks or months.

Similarly, the roll-out of the new methodology can be limited to a certain bit of the project itself. TDD, for example, 
can be used and experimented with on a very complex part of the codebase. Similarly, an agile methodology can be
limited to a single project, as long as that piece of code or project is allowed the time to go through the speed
impact associated with the learning curve.

## Personal Benefit

Another important aspect of implementing new methodologies is the question of *personal benefit*. A new methodology
inevitably means that the people involved will have either more work to do, or needing to do some work which is outside
their usual line of work.

The human brain works in such a way that familiar tasks seem easy, while new, unfamiliar ones are hard and needs a while
for people to get into. This means that we judge new things that need doing much harder and much more time consuming
than things we are already used to. This, in my experience, is more prevalent the longer the person in question has been
doing the same thing. If you see people who held the same job and have been doing the same thing for 10 or 20 years and
then you ask them to learn or do something new, you will have a very hard time convincing them that this is a good
thing.

One way to ease the transition to the new system is on an *emotional* level. Make the new task seem easier, or smoother.
Take the fear of the new. 

For example, show the person in question how exactly the new thing will make their life easier or better. When you do
that, make sure you don't fall in the trap of just using the same generic sales pitch, it won't work. Instead, tell
them, personally, how the new system will benefit them, personally.

You can also offer that you are there for them if they have issues with the new thing. They can come to you any time and
you will go through the new thing with them, personally. If this sounds like it won't scale, here's the trick: most
people won't make use of your offer, but having the safety net of you being there to support them gives them confidence
and ease of mind to look at the change ahead with a lighter heart.

## The Learning Experience

Moving to a new methodology is usually paired with some learning. Usually, if you think about the classic scenario, 
people will be called into a meeting room or a school-like room and someone will stand in front explaining how the hot
new thing will work. After having gone through this session (or multiple sessions) people will go back to their work,
taking some fraction of the discussed material with them.

The level of retention depends on many factors, including how good the educator is, how interested the audience is, and
last but not least, how this frontal learning style suits the people in the audience.

Having taught a number of classes I can safely say, not everyone learns the same. Some people prefer to understand the
overall concept first, others want to grasp one part of the whole first. Some people love to listen and take notes,
others can't sit still and listen if their life depends on it. (Like yours truly.) Some people want to listen to the
material, some prefer to read and again others need graphical representations.

The art, or shall I say, science of teaching is beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say, there is no one
way of learning, and if the audience fails to retain the learned material that is, in my experience, a failure of
motivation or teaching method, rather than the audience.

When it comes to motivation, specifically, I will have to circle back to what I already said about the personal benefit:
if the audience is not personally interested in the change, the teacher will have to do some extra legwork in order to
even get them to a level where they are willing to take in the information. Ignoring this will surely lead to a spotty
information retention.

## Wording matters

Many methodologies come with varying levels of documentation which describes several roles and concepts related to the 
methodology. Usually these *words* are then described as to what they mean.

My experience with these wordings are that they are almost universally awful. Take Scrum for example. There is a role
called *scrum master*, which is a person who is supposed to facilitate and help along the process of scrum. However, if
you failed to read the big fat book on Scrum, then the word *master* implies some sort of leadership role.

Those of you who know Scrum will now shout at the top of your lungs that that's not what it means, and *I know*. But
I lost count of how many times I saw the bosses of the old world take up the role of *master* because, after all, they
are the boss, completely misunderstanding the point of the whole thing.

The same goes for other terms, such as *project owner*. Does this mean that we, the workers, who have put in our sweat,
blood and tears, no longer own the project? Now some fancy pants suit guy will get to own it?

I know, I know, that's not what it means, but even if you explain these things words can cause emotions and cause
disenfranchisement. If the person in this role is conscious of this, they can help the process by behaving in a way that
furthers trust, but in contrast, that person can also ruin the whole thing by behaving in the negative ways that is
expected of them.

As with code, in roles and terminology *wording matters a lot*.
